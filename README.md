# sproute-json-route-format
This repository holds the JSON exchange format for routes developed by the Austrian Institute of Technology (AIT) and Fluidtime. It consists of geometries in GeoJSON format and important meta information used to properly display a route in a smart phone app.

The format is defined through the Java classes in the package `at.ac.ait.sproute.routeformat`.
Reading and writing of a route and exporting the JSON schema with Jackson is demonstrated in `JacksonExample.java`.
A simple example how to display a route in a browser with Leaflet is shown in `routeformat-usage-in-leaflet.html`.
